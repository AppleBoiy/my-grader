# MyGrader - Your Own CS111 Grader

The **MyGrader** project is a custom testing framework designed to help you test your user-defined functions
efficiently. It generates test cases, runs them against your functions, and provides detailed summaries of the test
results. This can be particularly useful for students and developers working on programming assignments.

## Installation

To install MyGrader, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install mygrader
```

MyGrader has a set of dependencies that will be automatically installed.

## Usage

1. **Define Your User-Defined Function**

Begin by defining the user-defined function you want to test. For example, let's say you have a
function `calculate_new_price` that calculates the new price of an item after applying a discount:

```python
def calculate_new_price(old_price):
    # ... (your code here) ...
    return new_price
```

2. **Use the Tester Class**

Utilize the `Tester` class from MyGrader to test your function. Create a Python script (e.g., `test_my_function.py`)
with the following code:

```python
from mygrader.tester import Tester


# Define your user-defined function
def calculate_new_price(old_price):


# ... (your code here) ...

# Create a Tester object
tester = Tester(year=2023, runtime_limit=4)

# Run tests for the function using 1000 test cases
tester.run_test(user_func=calculate_new_price, num_test_cases=1000)
```

3. **View the Test Summary**

After running the tests, you'll see a summary of the results. If you set `log_option` to `'print'`, the summary will be
printed to the console. If you set it to `'write'`, the summary will be saved to a file named `test_summary.md`.
